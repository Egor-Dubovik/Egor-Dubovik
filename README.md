## About me:
Hello, my name is Egor! I am a Frontend developer with over 1,5 years of commercial experience.
 
My stack: Next.jsâ–¸Reactâ–¸Reduxâ–¸Routerâ–¸TypeScriptâ–¸JS (ES6+)
 
In my work, I use SOLID, DRY, KISS and YANG principles, as well as Flux (Redux), Singleton, Render prop, Compound component and HOC patterns to develop high quality and scalable products.
 
I also had experience as a team leader in a team of 4 people, I successfully implemented the Scrum methodology from scratch. This allowed us to better understand the current progress of tasks, identify and solve problems, and significantly improve communication within the team. I'm always ready to share my experience and develop with the team.
 
English level B1.
 
Outside of work, I enjoy jogging, reading, table tennis, roller skating, chess and board games.
